## üíª Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **PHP:** Version 8.1 or higher.

* **Composer:** PHP dependency manager.

* **Node.js:** Version 16 or higher (LTS recommended).

* **Npm, Pnpm or Yarn:** JavaScript package managers.

* **Git:** For cloning the repository.

* **A Mysql database**

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/ShockieToky/TSDeck.git
    cd TSDeck
  
    ```

2. **Backend Setup (Symfony):**

* Install PHP dependencies:

  ```
  composer install
  
  ```

* Copy the example environment file and configure your database connection and other settings:

  ```
  cp .env .env.local
  # Open .env.local and configure DATABASE_URL, APP_ENV, etc.
  
  ```

* Create the database (if it doesn't exist) and run migrations:

  ```
  php bin/console doctrine:database:create
  php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
  
  ```

* (Optional) Load fixtures if your project uses them:

  ```
  php bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load
  
  ```

3. **Frontend Setup (React):**

* Install JavaScript dependencies:

  ```
  npm install # or yarn install
  
  ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Symfony development server:**
  
    ```
    symfony server:start # Or php -S 127.0.0.1:8000 -t public
  
    ```

This will typically run on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

2. **Start the React development server (Webpack Encore):**

    ```
    npm run watch # or yarn watch or pnpm run watch
  
    ```

This command will compile your frontend assets and watch for changes. The React application will be served through the Symfony server.

Your application should now be accessible in your web browser at the Symfony development server's address.
