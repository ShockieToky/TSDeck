We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 2-3 business days and will work with you to understand and address the issue. 

We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities as quickly as possible and will keep you informed of our progress.

## Responsible Disclosure

We kindly request that you:
  1. Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed and a fix has been released.
  2. Do not exploit the vulnerability beyond what is necessary to demonstrate it.
  3. Do not access or modify data that does not belong to you.

We are committed to protecting our users and appreciate your cooperation in helping us maintain a secure application.
